## Notes for this fork

This fork uses a LoRa32-TTGO board as a base station to forward the data to an MQTT server.  This data can then be sent to other destinations such as Home Assistant or ThingSpeak.  It is a work in progress.

There are several OpenSCAD source files which can be used to generate fittings for PVC pipes of different dimensions when the appropriate metric pipes are not available.

Many thanks to JP for making his project available to the public.
